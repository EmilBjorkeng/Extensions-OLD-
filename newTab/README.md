# newTab

## About
newTab is an extension for Firefox that changes the new tab. It is simple in design with just a Firefox logo and text in the middle of the screen and a solid colour background (at first). There is a side menu you can access with a settings icon in the top right, from the menu you can choose from variations of backgrounds to use. Just click on one of them to set it as your new tab background. With credits for the photos in the bottom left.

## Why?
I made the extension because when I switched from Chrome to Firefox I missed the background functionality that Chrome has on its new tab. I like my new tabs to have a cool background. I first started by using some custom CSS to add a background to the default Firefox new tab but felt it was a little restricting to have to go into the profile folder to change the image. I searched in the Firefox extensions website but couldn't find anything that I liked the look of. So I decided to make my own. I also needed an excuse to learn how to make extensions and this was the perfect starting project.
